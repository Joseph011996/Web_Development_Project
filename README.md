Designed a functioning online shopping system for an online business. This particular business doesn't have a physical store and functions entirely online. For this reason it is very important for them to have a well-designed web page.

The online shop is written with PHP, HTML5 and CSS.

1. The online shop system must allow customers to search for products of their interest and add them into a shopping cart.
2. When the user is ready to buy they will navigate to the view cart page where they will view the items in the cart. The user will then enter their username and click confirm order.
3. If the user does not have an account, they will need to sign up using the sign up form. Once the order has been confirmed the user is shown a receipt of the order.
4. The online shop will have two special pages.
   
      CustomerList.php will list the details of all the customer in the database. OrderList.php will list the details of all the orders in the database.
      These special pages are for the business owners, and are not intended for customers.
      Pages that are intended for customers should not display unnecessary technical details such as the ProductIDs or CustomerIDs.

5. The website has been secured from SQL Injection attacks and Cross site scripting attacks.

Below is a short clip of the final result.
